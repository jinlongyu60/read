# Integration Testing

Goals of Integration Testing

Springâ€™s integration testing support has the following primary goals:

- To manage Spring IoC container caching between test execution.
- To provide Dependency Injection of test fixture instances.
- To provide transaction management appropriate to integration testing.
- To supply Spring-specific base classes that assist developers in writing integration tests.

The next few sections describe each goal and provide links to implementation and configuration details.
