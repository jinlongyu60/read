# Template method pattern

- [Template method pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern)

In software engineering, the template method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses.[1] It lets one redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.[2] The template method is one of the twenty-three well-known patterns described in the "Gang of Four" book Design Patterns.
