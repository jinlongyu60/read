# Factory method pattern

[Factory method pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern)

## The Factory Method design pattern describes how to solve such problems:

- Define a separate operation (factory method) for creating an object.
- Create an object by calling a factory method.

This enables writing of _subclasses_ to change the way an object is created (to redefine which class to instantiate).
