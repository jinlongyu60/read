| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IP_MULTICAST_IF   | Set which outgoing interface on which to send multicast packets.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| IP_MULTICAST_IF2  | Same as above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| IP_MULTICAST_LOOP | This option enables or disables local loopback of multicast datagrams.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| IP_TOS            | This option sets the type-of-service or traffic class field in the IP header for a TCP or UDP socket.                                                                                                                                           |
| SO_BINDADDR       | Fetch the local address binding of a socket (this option cannot be "set" only "gotten", since sockets are bound at creation time, and so the locally bound address cannot be changed).                                                          |
| SO_BROADCAST      | Sets SO_BROADCAST for a socket.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `SO_KEEPALIVE`    | When the keepalive option is set for a TCP socket and no data has been exchanged across the socket in either direction for 2 hours (NOTE: the actual value is implementation dependent), TCP automatically sends a keepalive probe to the peer. |
| SO_LINGER         | Specify a linger-on-close timeout.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| SO_OOBINLINE      | When the OOBINLINE option is set, any TCP urgent data received on the socket will be received through the socket input stream.                                                                                                                  |
| `SO_RCVBUF`       | Set a hint the size of the underlying buffers used by the platform for incoming network I/O.                                                                                                                                                    |
| SO_REUSEADDR      | Sets SO_REUSEADDR for a socket.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `SO_SNDBUF`       | Set a hint the size of the underlying buffers used by the platform for outgoing network I/O.                                                                                                                                                    |
| `SO_TIMEOUT`      | Set a timeout on blocking Socket operations:                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `TCP_NODELAY`     | Disable Nagle's algorithm for this connection.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
