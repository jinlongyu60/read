## get start

There are problems with managing JavaScript projects this way:

It is not immediately apparent that the script depends on an external library.
If a dependency is missing, or included in the wrong order, the application will not function properly.
If a dependency is included but not used, the browser will be forced to download unnecessary code.
Let's use webpack to manage these scripts instead.

## code splitting

There are three general approaches to code splitting available:

* **Entry Points**: Manually split code using entry configuration.
* **Prevent Duplication**: Use the SplitChunks to dedupe and split chunks.
* **Dynamic Imports**: Split code via inline function calls within modules.
