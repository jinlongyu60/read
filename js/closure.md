# closure

闭包的作用：可以访问到一个不是在当前`范围`内的变量

- [closure javascript.info](https://javascript.info/closure)

This is because JavaScript has function-level scope. This is radically different from the C family. Blocks, such as if statements, do not create a new scope. Only functions create a new scope.

## closure 定义

- [from wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)>)

Unlike a plain function, a closure allows the function to access those captured variables through the closure's copies of their values or references, even when the function is invoked outside their scope.
